Die by the three.\nOne of the most common ideas about winning teams is when the three-pointers are not falling, They can still be dangerous from anywhere on the floor.\nThese teams can get to the free-throw line, finish in the paint, or even get to the mid-range.

It’s fitting that they would have winning teams who were above the average in mid-range field goals, while still making a high volume of three-point shots.\nTheir backcourt consists of two of the greatest three-point shooters in Klay Thompson and Steph Curry, then in 2016 they added four-time scoring champ Kevin Durant. He is known for getting anything he wants at all three-levels and goes to the mid-range frequently. He was the Finals MVP of those 2017 and 2018 teams, so his effect on the team is clear.\nIt’s after his departure in 2019 where the ball started to roll farther..\nThe 2022 Golden State Warriors had the lowest mid-range field goals at 3.9 per game, while also having the highest three-pointers made at 14.4 per game. As a team they are the biggest example that balance is not a necessity in today’s NBA. They are the most recent champions, but even the teams that won before them are demonstrating this philosophy.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n geom_line(data = TeamShooting, aes(x = Season, y = MIDFGM, group = TEAM), color = \"grey\", alpha = .3) +\n  geom_line(data = TeamShootinW_Champs, aes(x = Season, y = MIDFGM, group = TEAM), color = \"Red\", alpha =.5) +\n geom_point(data = TeamShootinW_Champs, aes(x = Season, y = MIDFGM, color = `Team and Season` ), size = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2013, 2022)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 12.5)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#F53811\", \"#000000\", \"#7CDDF4\", \"#AA817F\", \"#DED70A\", \"#1D429A\", \"#F8BE90\", \"#D59CEF\", \"#75AD43\", \"#2935F3\" )) +\n   labs(y = \"Mid-Range Field Goals Per Game \", \n        title = \"Teams are changing the gameplan.\",\n        subtitle = \"Each of the last four champions have significantly less Made Mid-Range shots.\",\n        caption = \"Source: NBA.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\" ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 12, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"dashed\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nIt has become a trend among teams to take less mid-range shots and phase it out of their game plan all across the league. However, it is especially apparent among the teams with rings.\nAfter 2014 there was a noticeable decline, until it rose again in 2016. Once 2019 hit these numbers sagged off dramatically and it’s clear that teams are moving from the need to have a balance in scoring. Even though it’s dying out, teams having an effective mid-range is not a bad thing.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = TopMDRPCT, aes(x = reorder(`Team and Season`, `NMIDFG%`), weight = `NMIDFG%`)) +\n  geom_bar(data = GSW2019_PHX2021_GSW2018, aes(x = reorder(`Team and Season`, `NMIDFG%`), weight = `NMIDFG%`, fill = `Champions` )) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title =  \"'The Lost Art' could still be useful.\",\n       subtitle = \"Three of the most efficient mid-range teams in the last decade have made the finals.\" , x=\"Team\", y= \"Mid-Range Percentage\",\n       caption = \"Source: NBA.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Red\", \"Green\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 12, face = 'bold'), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns as well as the 2018 and 2019 warriors all made the finals with some of the highest mid-range efficiency. Having a team that’s a three-level threat still makes it tough for some teams to guard and scheme around. Unfortunately for the “lost art”, only one of these teams actually won the championship.\nResults could have been different had Durant not torn his achilles in 2019, but the 2018 Warriors were the only ones to go all the way. It seems it might be a wiser idea for franchises to spend more resources on three-point shooting and the rings back it up\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = Top3PCT, aes(x = reorder(`Team and Season`, `N3P%`), weight = `N3P%`)) +\n  geom_bar(data = Top3PctFinalsTeam, aes(x = reorder(`Team and Season`, `N3P%`), weight = `N3P%`, fill = `Champions`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Hoisting threes is the way to go.\",\n       subtitle = \"Five of the most efficient teams from downtown made the big stage.\" , x=\"Team\", y= \"Three-point percentage\",\n       caption = \"Source: NBA.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Red\", \"Green\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 10, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nFive of the most efficient teams from behind the three-point line made it to the biggest stage in basketball. Four of those five managed to bring the Larry O’Brien back home and parade around their cities in front of thousands of fans. All five teams listed were close to winning. The 2016 Golden State Warriors were one game away from completing their record breaking 73-9 season before they blew a 3-1 lead.\nIt’s also worth noting that the 2018 warriors were top 10 in efficiency from mid-range and behind-the-line, but the line-up they had consisted of talent not many teams can replicate.\nTypically long-forwards like Durant are the ones who hit these the most, because of all the bodies in the paint. Combine that with him being an all-time talent, the numbers are going to reflect that. Even though they had the highest mid-range field goals made at 9.5 per game, they still were making about 11.2 threes per game.\nHaving a solid mid-range game to fall back on is never an issue, but the league is prioritizing three-point shooting. Nowadays everyone from the barely 6 foot point guards to the 7’5” Victor Wembanyama’s can make threes. Going all on in on deep shooting is not a bad idea when almost everyone can do it now.\nIn a league where the The 2022 Warriors won a ring shooting only four mid-range shots a game.\nSometimes you can live by the three and thrive by the three."

The Bucks were one of the top defenses anchored by Defensive Player of the Year-candidate Brook Lopez and a former two-time MVP and DPOY in Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nKhris Middleton was injured for much of last year’s playoffs and his floor-spacing next to Giannis was a pivotal part in the Bucks winning the championship a few years ago. Middleton was healthy and the gritty-backcourt duo of Grayson Allen and Jrue Holiday were ready to go.\nIt seemed the Bucks had another real chance to win the NBA Finals.\nAfter the dust of the play-in games finally cleared, the Miami Heat were the eighth seed. If they wanted to make any sort of deep-run, they would have to play the role of David in a 2023 rematch against Goliath.\nAnd they did it.They somehow toppled the Bucks.\nHow were they able to pull off a rare one versus eight seed matchup?\nNow Giannis did get injured in game 1, which forced him to miss games 2 and 3. It was a 2-1 series when he came back, but the Bucks had real opportunities to regain control.\nIn the regular season the Miami Heat consistently struggled to make things shake offensively, especially behind the three-point line.\n\n\nCode\n ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = RegSzn_shooting, aes(x = reorder(Team, `3P%`), weight = `3P%`)) +\n  geom_bar(data = RegMiami_Heat, aes(x = reorder(Team, `3P%`), weight = `3P%`, fill = `Team`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Heat had one of the worst offenses in the league.\",\n       subtitle = \"Miami was among bottom five in three-point shooting during the regular season.\" , x=\"Team\", y= \"Three-point percentage\",\n       caption = \"Source: NBA.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Red\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c()) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 12.5, face = 'bold'),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 9.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThey were among some of the worst shooting teams, so it comes as a big shock to see how their three-point shooting looked in the first round.\n\n\nCode\n ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = Playoff_TeamShooting, aes(x = reorder(Team, `3P%`), weight = `3P%`)) +\n  geom_bar(data = PlayoffMiami_Heat, aes(x = reorder(Team, `3P%`), weight = `3P%`, fill = Team)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Heat's offense improved dramatically in postseason.\",\n       subtitle = \"Miami turned things around to become the best shooting team in the playoffs.\" , x=\"Team\", y= \"Three-point percentage\",\n       caption = \"Source: NBA.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Red\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c()) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 12.5, face = 'bold'),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nThey led playoff teams in three-point percentage by quite a wide-margin. They did this without one of their best shooters in Tyler Herro, who had to miss the series with a broken hand.\nDuncan Robinson got more minutes in the series due to Herro’s injury and shot 73.7% from three on 4 attempts a game. Guys like Max Strus, Gabe Vincent, and Kevin Love all stepped up their play from deep as well. Another player who contributed in a huge role was none other than Jimmy Butler, who averaged 37.6 points on 44 percent shooting from three.\nButler stepped up his performance significantly from the regular season and enhanced the lore surrounding “Playoff Jimmy”.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = playoff_players_advanced, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"grey\", alpha= .5) +\n  geom_point(data = Jimmy, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = Steph, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = Barnes, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = Dill, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = Dev, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel( data = Jimmy, aes(x= BPM, y= PER , label=Player))  + \n  geom_text_repel( data = Steph, aes(x= BPM, y= PER , label=Player))  +\n  geom_text_repel( data = Barnes, aes(x= BPM, y= PER , label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel( data = Dev, aes(x= BPM, y= PER , label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel( data = Dill, aes(x= BPM, y= PER , label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Playoff Jimmy is a serious threat.\",\n       subtitle = \"Butler is one of the most productive and efficient players in the post season\",\n       x = \"Box Plus/Minus\", y = \"Player Efficiency Rating\", caption = \"Source: Basketball-Reference.com | Graphic By Branden Blue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"Red\", size = 12, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"dashed\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nButler was by far one of the most dominant players in all of the postseason. In game 4, Jimmy had a 56-point performance which is tied for fourth all-time. Then he followed that up with a 42-point outing to put the final nail in Milwaukee’s coffin.\nEven with Jimmy causing problems and Miami having a magnet attached to the net, the Bucks were still competitive for these games.\nIn some of these they even held sizable leads. In Game 4, Milwaukee had a 101-89 lead with 6:09 left to go in the game.\nWhen the scoring margin is five-points or less with under five minutes to go, this is referred to as Clutch time.

    "text": "About this blog\nThis is Branden Blue’s sports blog. I am a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln double majoring in Sports Media and Communications/Broadcasting with a minor in Film Studies. I have always had a passion for storytelling, especially when it comes to sports. In today’s age there are so many unique ways to tell stories and that is something I want to explore. My goal is to one day be apart of the crew for an ESPN 30-for-30."
